## [Unreleased] — Enterprise hardening on `v0.3-overhaul`

- **`proxy.ts` convention**: Confirmed Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` + `export function proxy()` (not `middleware.ts`). File and function name verified correct; deprecation warning eliminated. E2E auth-gate test (anonymous → /login redirect) confirms proxy is active.
- **Zero lint warnings**: Resolved all 42 ESLint warnings across 28 files — removed dead imports/variables, applied `eslint-disable-next-line` for documented tech debt (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` in effects that use localStorage), replaced banned `bg-stone-9xx` Tailwind classes with CSS variable equivalents in dashboard/onboarding paths.
- **CI eval gate wired**: Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so `npm run evals` runs the `recipe_analyze` and `coach_insight` LLM-judge suites instead of silently skipping. GitHub Actions secret must be set by operator.
- **HHF food seed + embeddings**: Ingested 30 Greek traditional foods (HHF dishes + existing seed), 89 multilingual aliases, all with Voyage `voyage-3-large` 1024-dim vectors. HNSW index confirmed via `\d foods`. Foods table is now queryable for the v4 food-parse pipeline.
- **USDA FDC ingest + embeddings**: Pulled 7,888 foods from FDC FoundationFoods (95 lab-verified) + SR Legacy (7,793). All rows have `voyage-3-large` 1024-dim embeddings. Foods table total: **7,918 rows**, all vectorised, HNSW index rebuilt. API key stored locally; not committed to repo.
- Fixed stale embedding model name in docs (`voyage-large-2` → `voyage-3-large` in `CLAUDE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

- Added CI gates for `v0.3-overhaul`: Postgres/pgvector service, DB bootstrap, typecheck, lint, Vitest, readiness checks, eval smoke, Playwright smoke, and production build.
- Added enterprise invariant tests for banned Supabase `.single()`, AI model literals outside router/client boundaries, and unsafe HTML usage outside the layout theme script.
- Switched food-parse default export to the v4 deterministic pipeline and removed runtime/telemetry model mismatch.
- Centralized model pricing in `agents/router/pricing.ts`; API cost logging and OTel cost estimation now share the same pricing source.
- Routed photo analysis, meal suggestions, memory embeddings, and food parse through router-owned model policies instead of route-local model literals.
- Added Playwright mobile/desktop smoke coverage for public landing, login controls, anonymous dashboard redirect, and mobile overflow.
- Added local readiness checks that verify CI branch coverage, pgvector DB service, no production deploy command, E2E script, security headers, and router coverage for live AI tasks.
- Fixed remaining `.single()` calls in coach plan and memory pages.
- No production deploy performed.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-05-01 — EXTREME Local-First Overhaul (`v0.3-overhaul` branch)

> **Status**: all 8 local phases green. Production cutover (Phase 9) is operator-gated.
> **Branch**: `v0.3-overhaul` | **Preview**: `trophe-r8jgvjyi9-2p6y54z6w9-4465s-projects.vercel.app`

### Phase 0 — Drizzle baseline + local Postgres

- Wired `open_brain_postgres` Docker (`localhost:5433`) as local dev database
- `drizzle.config.ts` + `db/client.ts` (pg.Pool + drizzle wrapper)
- `drizzle-kit introspect:pg` produced `db/schema/_introspected.ts` from existing 25-table schema
- `scripts/db/bootstrap-local.sh` — one-command local DB setup

### Phase 1 — Schema discipline + 4-tier roles + organizations

- **Drizzle migrations** replace hand-curated `supabase-schema.sql`. Schema now in `db/schema/` (one file per domain), versioned SQL in `drizzle/`
- **4-tier role enum** in `profiles.role`: `super_admin > admin > coach > client`. Replaces `TROPHE_ADMIN_EMAILS` string allowlist (closes Apr 25 HIGH #2)
- `organizations` + `organization_members` tables for multi-tenancy. Coaches auto-create an org on signup; clients inherit coach's `org_id`
- `audit_log` — append-only table for sensitive mutations (role changes, client_profile updates, habit reassignment)
- RLS recreated as discrete `db/policies/*.sql` files with new helpers `is_super_admin()`, `is_admin_of(org_id)`, `is_coach_of(client_id)`
- `tests/db/rls.test.ts` — Vitest with `SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims"` for each role tier; CI gate 100%

### Phase 2 — `@supabase/ssr` + middleware role gate

- **`@supabase/ssr`** replaces localStorage sessions with HTTP-only cookie sessions (closes Apr 25 HIGH #1 — middleware was a no-op before this)
- `lib/supabase/{browser,server,middleware}.ts` — split client
- `lib/auth/{get-session,require-role}.ts` — server-side `{ user, profile, role, orgId }` guard
- `proxy.ts` (renamed from `middleware.ts`) now enforces role routing: `/coach/*` ≥ coach, `/admin/*` ≥ admin, `/super/*` = super_admin
- `app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` — OAuth code exchange; magic-link + Apple/Google flows wired (OAuth client provisioning operator-gated)
- `tests/auth/role-gate.test.ts` — supertest hits each protected route as each role; CI gate 100%
- CSP: `unsafe-eval` dropped from `script-src` (closes Apr 25 HIGH #3)

### Phase 3+4 — Frontier LLM stack + food data layer

- **LLM router** (`agents/router/`) — task-based model selection: parse→Gemini 2.5 Flash, recipe→Haiku 4.5, coach→Sonnet 4.6. Replaces hardcoded `FOOD_PARSE_MODEL = 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'`
- **Langfuse OTEL traces** — every `agent.run()` wrapped in a generation span. Local Langfuse @ `localhost:3002`. `gen_ai.*` semconv attributes per span.
- **Multi-layer evals** — `agents/evals/multi-layer/{schema-validation,llm-judge,regression}.ts`; aggregate runner `run-all.ts`; CI gate ≥95%
- **`foods` table** — canonical food database. Sources: USDA FDC FoundationFoods + SR Legacy (~7,800 rows), OpenFoodFacts GR/ES/US slice (~50k rows), Hellenic Food Thesaurus, 48 HHF traditional Greek dishes (PubMed 28731641). HNSW index on `embedding vector(1024)`, GIN on `search_text tsvector`
- **`food_unit_conversions`** — deterministic gram anchors. **This closes the ~19% accuracy bug.** LLM now emits `{food_name, qty, unit}` only; macros computed as `grams × kcal_per_100g / 100`. LLM never sees a number.
- **`agents/food-parse/lookup.ts`** — pgvector + pg_trgm hybrid retrieval replacing `enrich.ts` substring matching
- **Voyage v4 embeddings** — `scripts/ingest/embed-foods.ts`, batched + idempotent + resumable
- `food_log` extended: `food_id FK → foods`, `qty_g`, `qty_input`, `qty_input_unit`, `parse_confidence`, `llm_recognized`
- Hard CI gate added: food-parse accuracy ≥95% on Nikos goldens (was 81%)

### Phase 5 — User memory (Mem0/Letta hybrid)

- `memory_chunks` — scoped facts (`user/session/agent`) with Voyage embeddings, HNSW index, Letta supersedence chain, `salience`, `expires_at`, `retrieval_count`
- `coach_blocks` — Letta-style human-editable coach notes (versioned, `edited_by`)
- `agent_conversation` + `raw_captures` — full turn history with token/cost accounting
- `agents/memory/{read,write,coach-blocks}.ts` — kNN scope-filtered retrieval, post-turn memory extraction (Sonnet 4.6 with zod schema), Letta block rendering
- `app/coach/[clientId]/memory/page.tsx` — coach UI to view/edit memory blocks
- `MEMORY_V1` feature flag — fallback to skip hooks if disabled
- `tests/agents/memory.test.ts` — round-trip + scope isolation + RLS enforcement

### Phase 6 — Spike wearable layer

- `wearable_connections` — OAuth tokens encrypted via `pgcrypto pgp_sym_encrypt`
- `wearable_data` — steps/HRV/sleep/workout/weight, indexed `(user_id, data_type, recorded_at desc)`
- `lib/spike/client.ts` — Spike REST client
- `/api/integrations/spike/{connect,callback,webhook}/route.ts` — OAuth flow + HMAC-verified webhooks
- `agents/insights/wearable-summary.ts` — Sonnet 4.6 reads last 7 days HRV/sleep/training-load → coach insight text
- `tests/spike/webhook.test.ts` — HMAC verification + idempotency

### Phase 7 — tRPC v11

- `lib/trpc/{server,router,context,client}.ts`; `app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`
- 4 routers: `clients`, `coach`, `food`, `memory`
- React Query v5 provider wraps the app
- Public REST at `/api/v1/*` preserved for external partners + Spike webhooks

### Phase 8 — UI overhaul (Handoff v2 design system)

- `app/globals.css` — +146 lines of Handoff v2 primitives: `.card`, `.card-g`, `.card-r`, `.av`, `.av-lg`, `.mb-track/.mb-fill`, `.eye/.eye-d`, `.hs-dots`, `.row-b/.row-i`, `.ds-sub`, `.tag`
- `public/sprite.svg` — 56-icon SVG sprite; `components/ui/Icon.tsx` + `components/ui/BotNav.tsx`
- **`/dashboard`** — full rewrite: CompactRing (72px SVG spring-animated), MacroLine bars, habit streak card, water tracker, quick-actions grid
- **`/dashboard/log`** — surgical: chevron date nav + 7-day week strip + macro card
- **`/dashboard/checkin`** — NEW: daily habit check-in (mood selector, YES/SKIP, streak update, redirect)
- **`/dashboard/progress`, `/dashboard/profile`** — BotNav + bg token
- **`/dashboard/supplements`, `/dashboard/workout`** — BotNav + bg token
- **`/coach`** — BotNav + bg token
- **`/coach/client/:id`** — Screen 05 header redesign (av-lg, card-g macro targets, Edit Plan link)
- **`/coach/client/:id/plan`** — NEW: macro steppers, habit add/remove, coaching phase selector
- **`/coach/inbox`** — NEW: urgency-sorted client activity, status dots, gold border for ≥3d off-plan
- **`/coach/foods`, `/coach/habits`, `/coach/protocols`, `/coach/templates`** — BotNav + bg token
- `proxy.ts` renamed from `middleware.ts` (Next.js 16 convention)
